## vi/vim delete commands

```
x   - delete current character
10x - delete 10 character
dw  - delete current word
dd  - delete current line
5dd - delete five lines

d$  - delete to end of line
d0  - delete to beginning of line

:1,.d

```

## Copy and Paste

```
// Copy
yy or Y – yank the current line, including the newline character at the end of the line
y$ – yank to the end of the current line (but don't yank the newline character); note that many people like to remap Y to y$ in line with C and D
yiw – yank the current word (excluding surrounding whitespace)
yaw – yank the current word (including leading or trailing whitespace)
ytx – yank from the current cursor position up to and before the character (til x)
yfx – yank from the current cursor position up to and including the character (find x)

// Paste
In normal mode, one can use p to paste after the cursor, or P to paste before the cursor.
The variants gp and gP move the cursor after the pasted text, instead of leaving the cursor stationary.

- `gd` will take you to the local declaration.
- `gD` will take you to the global declaration.
- `g*` search for the word under the cursor (like *, but g* on 'rain' will find words like 'rainbow').
- `g#` same as g* but in backward direction.
- `gg` goes to the first line in the buffer (or provide a count before the command for a specific line).
- `G` goes to the last line (or provide a count before the command for a specific line).
