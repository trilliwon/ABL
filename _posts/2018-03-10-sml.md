> Computation in ML consists of evaluation of expressions. Each expression
has three important characteristics:

- It may or may not have a `type`.
- It may or may not have a `value`.
- It may or may not engender an `effect`.

---

> What is a type? What types are there? Generally speaking, a type is defined
by specifying three things:

- a `name` for the type,
- the `values` of the type, and
- the `operations` that may be performed on values of the type.

## Examples

- `val m : int = 0`
- `val x : real = Math.sqrt(2.0)`
- `val c : char = #"a"`


## Functions


- `fn n=>n+1`

```
(* merge: int list * int list -> int list *)

fun merge (a: int list, b: int list) =
  a @ b;
```
