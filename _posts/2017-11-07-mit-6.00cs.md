I just started to learn MIT OCW course 6.00SC [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/).


- [First lecture](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/unit-1/lecture-1-introduction-to-6.00/) Introduction to 6.00

### What to remember

- What is the difference between declarative and imperative knowledge?
    - Declarative knowledge is statements of fact; imperative knowledge is "how to" knowledge.

- What is the advantage of a stored-program computer?
    - It's far more versatile than a fixed-program computer, since it interprets a program given to it and carries out those instructions, as opposed to being built to do one thing.

- What are the syntax, static semantics, and semantics of a language?
    - Syntax determines whether a string is legal, static semantics determine whether the string has meaning, and semantics assigns a meaning to a legal sentence (assuming no static semantic errors).

- What sorts of errors can occur in a program?
    - It can crash, run forever, or give a wrong answer.
