## Copy and Paste

```
// Copy
yy or Y – yank the current line, including the newline character at the end of the line
y$ – yank to the end of the current line (but don't yank the newline character); note that many people like to remap Y to y$ in line with C and D
yiw – yank the current word (excluding surrounding whitespace)
yaw – yank the current word (including leading or trailing whitespace)
ytx – yank from the current cursor position up to and before the character (til x)
yfx – yank from the current cursor position up to and including the character (find x)

// Paste
In normal mode, one can use p to paste after the cursor, or P to paste before the cursor.
The variants gp and gP move the cursor after the pasted text, instead of leaving the cursor stationary.
