## Graphics Rendering: Render Command Encoder

![](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Miscellaneous/Conceptual/MetalProgrammingGuide/Art/gfx-pipeline_2x.png)
Metal Graphics Rendering Pipeline

- A MTLRenderCommandEncoder object represents a single rendering command encoder
- A MTLParallelRenderCommandEncoder object enables a single rendering pass to be broken into a number of separate MTLRenderCommandEncoder objects, each of which may be assigned to a different thread. 


## Creating and Using a Render Command Encoder

1. Create a `MTLRenderPassDescriptor` object to define a collection of attachments that serve as the rendering destination for the graphics commands in the command buffer for that rendering pass. Typically, you create a `MTLRenderPassDescriptor` object once and reuse it each time your app renders a frame. See Creating a Render Pass Descriptor.
2. Create a MTLRenderCommandEncoder object by calling the renderCommandEncoderWithDescriptor: method of MTLCommandBuffer with the specified render pass descriptor. See Using the Render Pass Descriptor to Create a Render Command Encoder.
3. Create a MTLRenderPipelineState object to define the state of the graphics rendering pipeline (including shaders, blending, multisampling, and visibility testing) for one or more draw calls. To use this render pipeline state for drawing primitives, call the setRenderPipelineState: method of MTLRenderCommandEncoder. For details, see Creating a Render Pipeline State.
4. Set textures, buffers, and samplers to be used by the render command encoder, as described in Specifying Resources for a Render Command Encoder.
5. Call MTLRenderCommandEncoder methods to specify additional fixed-function state, including the depth and stencil state, as explained in Fixed-Function State Operations.
6. Finally, call MTLRenderCommandEncoder methods to draw graphics primitives, as described in Drawing Geometric Primitives.
