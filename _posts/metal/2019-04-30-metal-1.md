# Metal Programming Guide

- [Metal Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Miscellaneous/Conceptual/MetalProgrammingGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014221)

> The Metal framework supports GPU-accelerated advanced 3D **graphics rendering** and **data-parallel computation workloads**.
> Metal provides a modern and streamlined API for fine-grained, low-level control of the organization, processing and submission of graphic and computation commands, as well as the management of the associated data and resources for these commands.
> A primary goal of Metal is to minimize the CPU overhead incurred by executing GPU workloads.

## Fundamental Metal Concepts

> Metal provides a single, unified programming interface and language for both graphics and data-parallel computation workloads. Metal enables you to integrate graphics and computation tasks much more efficiently without needing to use separate APIs and shader languages.

### Metal framework provides

- Low-overhead interface
    - You get control over the asynchronous behavior of the GPU for efficient multithreading used to create and commit command buffers in parallel.
- Memory and resource menagement
- Integrated support for both graphic and compute operations
- Precompiled shaders


### Command Organization and Execution Model

#### MTLDevice

- `MTLDevice` protocol defines the interface that represents a single GPU.
- A `command queue` consists of a queue of `command buffers`, and a `command queue` organizes the order of execution of those `command buffers`.
- A command buffer contains encoded commands that are intended for execution on a particular device.
- A command encoder appends rendering, computing, and blitting commands onto a command buffer, and those command buffers are eventually committed for execution on the device.

#### MTLCommandQueue

- The `MTLCommandQueue` protocol defines an interface for command queues, primarily supporting methods for creating command buffer objects.
- The `MTLCommandBuffer` protocol defines an interface for command buffers and provides methods for creating command encoders, enqueueing command buffers for execution, checking status, and other operations. 
- Encoder types
    - The `MTLRenderCommandEncoder` protocol encodes graphics (3D) rendering commands for a single rendering pass.
    - The `MTLComputeCommandEncoder` protocol encodes data-parallel computation workloads.
    - The `MTLBlitCommandEncoder` protocol encodes simple copy operations between buffers and textures, as well as utility operations like mipmap generation.
- At any point in time, only a single command encoder can be active and append commands into a command buffer. 
- Each command encoder must be ended before another command encoder can be created for use with the same command buffer.
- The one exception to the **“one active command encoder for each command buffer”** rule is the `MTLParallelRenderCommandEncoder` protocol, discussed in `Encoding a Single Rendering Pass Using Multiple Threads`.

### The Device Object Represents a GPU

> The `MTLDevice` object represent a GPU that can execute commands.
> The MTLDevice protocol has methods **to create new command queues**, **to allocate buffers from memory**, **to create textures**, and **to make queries about the device’s capabilities**.

```swift
let defaultDevice = MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice()
```

### Transient and Non-transient Objects in Metal

- `Command buffer` and `command encoder` objects are transient and designed for a single use. They are very inexpensive to allocate and deallocate, so their creation methods return autoreleased objects.
- The following objects are not transient. Reuse these objects in performance sensitive code, and avoid creating them repeatedly.
    - Command queues
    - Data buffers
    - Textures
    - Sampler states
    - Libraries
    - Compute states
    - Render pipeline states
    - Depth/stencil states


### Command Queue

- A command queue accepts an ordered list of command buffers that the GPU will execute.
- All command buffers sent to a single queue are guaranteed to execute in the order in which the command buffers were enqueued.
- In general, command queues are expected to be long-lived, so they should not be repeatedly created and destroyed.


```swift
let commandQueue = defaultDevice.makeCommandQueue()
```

### Command Buffer

- A `command buffer` stores encoded commands until the buffer is committed for execution by the GPU.
- A single command buffer can contain many different kinds of encoded commands, depending on the number and type of encoders that are used to build it.
- In a typical app, an entire frame of rendering is encoded into a single command buffer, even if rendering that frame involves multiple rendering passes, compute processing functions, or blit operations.
- Command buffers are transient single-use objects and do not support reuse.
- Once a command buffer has been committed for execution, the only valid operations are to wait for the command buffer to be scheduled or completed—through synchronous calls or handler blocks discussed in Registering Handler Blocks for Command Buffer Execution—and to check the status of the command buffer execution.
- Command buffers also represent the only independently trackable unit of work by the app, and they define the coherency boundaries established by the Metal memory model, as detailed in Resource Objects: Buffers and Textures.


#### Creating a Command Buffer

```swift
let commandBuffer = queue.makeCommandBuffer()
let commandBuffer = queue.makeCommandBufferWithUnretainedReferences() // only for extremely performance-critical apps
```

#### Executing Commands

- A command buffer does not begin execution until it is committed.
- Once committed, command buffers are executed in the order in which they were enqueued.
- The `enqueue` method reserves a place for the command buffer on the command queue, but does not commit the command buffer for execution. When this command buffer is eventually committed, it is executed after any previously enqueued command buffers within the associated command queue.
- The `commit` method causes the command buffer to be executed as soon as possible, but after any previously enqueued command buffers in the same command queue are committed. If the command buffer has not previously been enqueued, commit makes an implied enqueue call.

```swift
commandBuffer.enqueue()
commandBuffer.commit()
```

#### Registering Handler Blocks for Command Buffer Execution

- The MTLCommandBuffer methods listed below monitor command execution. Scheduled and completed handlers are invoked in execution order on an undefined thread. Any code you execute in these handlers should complete quickly; if expensive or blocking work needs to be done, defer that work to another thread.

```
// should be called before calling commit() method
commandBuffer?.addCompletedHandler({ commandBuffer in })
commandBuffer?.addScheduledHandler({ commandBuffer in })
```


#### Monitoring Command Buffer Execution Status

- The read-only status property contains a MTLCommandBufferStatus enum value listed in [Command Buffer Status Codes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlcommandbufferstatus) that reflects the current scheduling stage in the lifetime of this command buffer.

- If execution finishes successfully, the value of the read-only error property is nil. If execution fails, then status is set to MTLCommandBufferStatusError, and the error property may contain a value listed in [Command Buffer Error Codes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlcommandbuffererror/code) that indicates the cause of the failure.


### Command Encoder

- A command encoder is a transient object that you use once to write commands and state into a single command buffer in a format that the GPU can execute. 
- Many command encoder object methods append commands onto the command buffer.
- While a command encoder is active, it has the exclusive right to append commands for its command buffer. 
- Once you finish encoding commands, call the endEncoding method. To write further commands, create a new command encoder.

#### Creating a Command Encoder Object

- Because a command encoder appends commands into a specific command buffer, you create a command encoder by requesting one from the MTLCommandBuffer object you want to use it with. Use the following MTLCommandBuffer methods to create command encoders of each type:
    - The renderCommandEncoderWithDescriptor: method creates a MTLRenderCommandEncoder object for graphics rendering to an attachment in a MTLRenderPassDescriptor.
    - The computeCommandEncoder method creates a MTLComputeCommandEncoder object for data-parallel computations.
    - The blitCommandEncoder method creates a MTLBlitCommandEncoder object for memory operations.
    - The parallelRenderCommandEncoderWithDescriptor: method creates a MTLParallelRenderCommandEncoder object that enables several MTLRenderCommandEncoder objects to run on different threads while still rendering to an attachment that is specified in a shared MTLRenderPassDescriptor.

#### Render Command Encoder

> Graphics rendering can be described in terms of a rendering pass. 
> A MTLRenderCommandEncoder object represents the rendering state and drawing commands associated with a single rendering pass.
> A MTLRenderCommandEncoder requires an associated MTLRenderPassDescriptor (described in Creating a Render Pass Descriptor) that includes the color, depth, and stencil attachments that serve as destinations for rendering commands.
 
 - Specify graphics resources, such as buffer and texture objects, that contain vertex, fragment, or texture image data
- Specify a `MTLRenderPipelineState` object that contains compiled rendering state, including vertex and fragment shaders
- Specify fixed-function state, including viewport, triangle fill mode, scissor rectangle, depth and stencil tests, and other values
- Draw 3D primitives

```swift
let commandEncoder = commandBuffer?.makeComputeCommandEncoder()
```

#### Compute Command Encoder

- For data-parallel computing, the MTLComputeCommandEncoder protocol provides methods to encode commands in the command buffer that can specify the compute function and its arguments (for example, texture, buffer, and sampler state) and dispatch the compute function for execution.
- To create a compute command encoder object, use the computeCommandEncoder method of MTLCommandBuffer.



### Multiple Threads, Command Buffers, and Command Encoders

- Most apps use a single thread to encode the rendering commands for a single frame in a single command buffer.
- At the end of each frame, you commit the command buffer, which both schedules and begins command execution.
