# Functions and Libraries

> [link](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Miscellaneous/Conceptual/MetalProgrammingGuide/Prog-Func/Prog-Func.html)

- `MTLFunction` Represents a Shader or Compute Function
- A `MTLFunction` object represents a single function that is written in the Metal shading language and executed on the GPU as part of a graphics or compute pipeline. 

## A Library Is a Repository of Functions

> A MTLLibrary object represents a repository of one or more MTLFunction objects. A single MTLFunction object represents one Metal function that has been written with the shading language. In the Metal shading language source code, any function that uses a Metal function qualifier (vertex, fragment, or kernel) can be represented by a MTLFunction object in a library. A Metal function without one of these function qualifiers cannot be directly represented by a MTLFunction object, although it can called by another function within the shader.
