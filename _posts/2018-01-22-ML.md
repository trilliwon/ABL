## Tensors - A tensor is a generalization of vectors and matrices to potentially higher dimensions. Internally, TensorFlow represents tensors as n-dimensional arrays of base datatypes.

  - Types of Tensors
    - `tf.Variable`
    - `tf.Constant`
    - `tf.Placeholder`
    - `tf.SparseTensor`
  - Rank : The rank of a `tf.Tensor` object is its number of dimensions.
  - Shape : The shape of a tensor is the number of elements in each dimension.
  - Data Types
  - Evaluating Tensors
  - Printing Tensors

## Graphs and Sessions
  - TensorFlow uses a dataflow graph to represent your computation in terms of the dependencies between individual operations.
  - *Dataflow* is a common programming model for parallel computing.
    - the nodes represent units of computation
    - the edges represent the data consumed or produced by a computation
