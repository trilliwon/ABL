# Topics covered
 - Guess and Check, Approximation, Specification, Exhaustive Enumeration (Brute force), Decrementing function

## Decrementing function properties
  - It will map some set of program variables to an integer.
  - The value of the variable is non-negative when entering the loop for first time.
  - When the value of the integer is less than 0, loop terminates.
  - The value is decreased each time in the loop.

## Exhaustive Enumeration (Brute force)
  - Why? Because Computers are very fast.

## Bisection Search
  - Cut search space in half each iteration

## The problem is to write a fast algorithm that gives you the right answer.

## What does it mean for a program to terminate?
  - Either the program will return a value, or throw an exception.
  - A program that does not terminate runs indefinitely, typically because it's gotten stuck in a loop.

## What is a for loop?
  - A for loop takes some sort of iterable object (a list, tuple, or string) and
  - performs its function once for each item in that object.
  - Any function that depends on the input can have a different result at each step,
  - since the input is the current item.
