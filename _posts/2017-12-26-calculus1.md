# Inverse Trigonometric Functions
  - Trigonometric functions are not one-to-one, they don't have inverse functions.
  - The difficulty is overcome by restricting the domains of these functions so that they become one-to-one.

# Function
  - A **Function** is a rule that assigns to each element **x** in a set **D** exactly one element, called **f(x)**, in a set **E**.

# Cancellation Equation

  - **f<sup>-1</sup>(f(x)) = x**
  - **f(f<sup>-1</sup>(x)) = x**
