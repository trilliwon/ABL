### strcmp

##### compare two string
- `int strcmp ( const char * str1, const char * str2 );`
  - `< 0` : the first character that does not match has a lower value in ptr1 than in ptr2
  - `0` : the contents of both strings are equal
  - `> 0` : the first character that does not match has a greater value in ptr1 than in ptr2

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main ()
{
  char key[] = "apple";
  char buffer[80];
  do {
     printf ("Guess my favorite fruit? ");
     fflush (stdout);
     scanf ("%79s",buffer);
  } while (strcmp (key,buffer) != 0);
  puts ("Correct answer!");
  return 0;
}
```
