### preprocessing directive of the form
```
#define identifier replacement_string
```

### Flow of control
```
if-else
switch
while
break
continue
goto
return

{ ... } // compound statement
```

### Structured programming

- structured programming is a problem-solving strategy and a programming methodology
that includes the following two guidelines
- The flow of control in a program should be as simple as possible
- The construction of a program should embody top-down design

### **Top-down design(stepwise refinement)** consists of repeatedly decomposing a problem into smaller problems.

### Function

```
// prototype
type function_name ( parameter type list );

type function_name ( parameter type list )
{
  declarations
  statements
}
```
- When a function is called, programm control is passed to the function. When a return statement is executed, or the end of the function is reched, control is passed back to the calling environment.

### Recursion

- Recursion is the ability of a function to call itself, either directly or indirectly.

### Data type

- `char` `int` `double` `float`...
- ASCII value

### char

```
putchar('\n');
getchar();

while (( c = getchar()) != EOF)

#include <ctype.h>

isalpha(c);
isupper(c);
islower(c);
isdigit(c);
isalnum(c);
isxdigit(c);
isspace(c);
ispunct(c);
ispring(c);
isgraph(c);
iscntrl(c);
isascii(c); // is ASCII

toupper(c);
tolower(c);
toascii(c);

```

### Program Correctness: The assert() Macro

```
assert(10 > 9);

// precondition
// postcondition
// if assertion fails, the system prints out a message and abort the program.
```
### The sizeof Operator

- C provides the unary operator sizeof to find the number of bytes needed to store an object.
- `sizeof(object)` returns an integer that represents the number of bytes needed to store the object in memory.

### Type cast

### strcmp

##### compare two string
- `int strcmp ( const char * str1, const char * str2 );`
  - `< 0` : the first character that does not match has a lower value in ptr1 than in ptr2
  - `0` : the contents of both strings are equal
  - `> 0` : the first character that does not match has a greater value in ptr1 than in ptr2

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main ()
{
  char key[] = "apple";
  char buffer[80];
  do {
     printf ("Guess my favorite fruit? ");
     fflush (stdout);
     scanf ("%79s",buffer);
  } while (strcmp (key,buffer) != 0);
  puts ("Correct answer!");
  return 0;
}
```
