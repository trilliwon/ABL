## What is [Cscope](http://cscope.sourceforge.net)?

- Tool for browsing source code
- Originally developed in Bell labs
- Open source

## Feature

- Allows searching code for:
    - all references to a symbol
    - global definitions
    - functions called by a function
    - functions calling a function
    - text string
    - regular expression pattern
    - a file
    - files including a file
- Curses based (text screen)
- An information database is generated for faster searches and later reference
- The fuzzy parser supports C, but is flexible enough to be useful for C++ and Java, and for use as a generalized 'grep database' (use it to browse large text documents!)
- Has a command line mode for inclusion in scripts or as a backend to a GUI/frontend
- Runs on all flavors of Unix, plus most monopoly-controlled operating systems.
